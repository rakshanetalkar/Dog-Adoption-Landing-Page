                Dog food is food specifically formulated and intended for consumption by dogs and other related canines.
                Dogs are considered to be omnivores with a carnivorous bias.
                They have the sharp, pointed teeth and shorter gastrointestinal tracts of carnivores, better suited for the consumption of meat than of vegetable substances, yet also have ten genes that are responsible for starch and glucose digestion, as well as the ability to produce amylase, an enzyme that functions to break down carbohydrates into simple sugars
                something that obligate carnivores like cats lack
                Dogs evolved the ability living alongside humans in agricultural societies,
                 as they managed on scrap leftovers and excrement from humans.
